## Where the work is

| | |
|---|---|
| Branch | **`main`** |
| Milestone | **M0 — decisions and architecture.** No engine code |
| Scope | **[PRD.md](docs/PRD.md)** — phase 1 = FIX 4.4 tag=value both sides; phase 2 = SBE / FAST / FIXML + FIX 5.0. **TLS has ADR-0005 (Accepted) but no plan — blocked on open item 10** |
| Plan in flight | **[2026-08-27-codec-dict.md](docs/plans/2026-08-27-codec-dict.md)** — **approved 2026-08-27.** Ready to build; nothing started |
| Plan queued | **[2026-08-27-repeating-groups.md](docs/plans/2026-08-27-repeating-groups.md)** — **approved 2026-08-27.** Starts after codec-dict step 1. Closes open item 8 |
| Last closed | Design reviewed against the HFT latency budget and revised: positioning fixed to "fastest acceptor on kernel TCP", ADR-0002 default reversed (inline dispatch, ring optional), D8 busy-poll, D9 template encoder, D10 send backpressure, §8 latency budget, §9 OS checklist, wire-to-wire gate added |

## Proven — the command was run and its output read

- **The 512-entry inline field array in `matthart1983/nanofix` costs 4–6× the parse time.**
  Changing `MAX_FIELDS` 512 → 64 took the heartbeat from 565.0 ns to **95.4 ns** and
  `NewOrderSingle` from 605.1 ns to **138.8 ns**, on an Apple M5 on 2026-08-27. Method and
  caveats: [docs/reference/measured-costs.md](docs/reference/measured-costs.md).
- `cargo test --no-default-features --lib` on that project **fails to link** — its `aeron`
  feature does not gate `mod aeron_c;`. Its "238 tests" cannot be run as shipped.
- `scripts/fetch-quickfix-assets.sh` runs and reports **59 acceptance definitions** on disk.
- The `.def` format was decoded from the files and `Comparator.rb`: 7 directives, one
  `<TIME>` placeholder, literal `0x01` separators. It pins **field ordering** positionally.
- **The ordering rule is tag-ascending within header and body, not XML order** — checked by
  script over all 247 expected lines, zero violations. Open item 4 closed by data.
- **`test/definitions/client/` holds exactly one file** — `Normal.def`, 271 bytes, 6 lines,
  FIX 4.2, logon then logout. **470 of the 471 `.def` files test the acceptor.** It also uses
  two directives absent from the seven recorded for the server format: a bare `eCONNECT`, and
  `R` for a reply the harness sends. This answers ADR-0001 open question 1: there is no
  initiator conformance suite to run, and that is the central cost priced in ADR-0004.
- The QuickFIX Software License was read directly: BSD-3 in shape, plus attribution and a
  naming restriction.
- `git check-ignore -v` blocks `vendor/`, `testdata/recordings/`, `*.docx`, `target/`,
  `.DS_Store`.
- Repository is **private** as of 2026-08-27 (it was public at creation). `cargo 1.95.0`.
- **ADR-0001, -0002, -0003 accepted 2026-08-27** by the owner, after the latency-budget review.
- **CI exists as of 2026-08-28**, and closes a gap that had been asserted eight times. "CI
  proves it" appeared in `CLAUDE.md` §2, ADR-0004, ADR-0005, `DESIGN.md` D11 and `PRD.md`
  while `.github/` did not exist. It now has three jobs. Two of them cannot do anything yet —
  there are no crates — and they emit a *skipped, not passed* annotation rather than a silent
  green tick.
- **`[workspace.lints.clippy] all = "warn"` did not enforce non-negotiable 7.** `[measured]`
  2026-08-28: a library crate containing `unwrap()`, `expect()` and `panic!()` passed
  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` with **exit 0**, because those three are
  `clippy::restriction` lints and `clippy::all` never includes them. `CLAUDE.md` §2 had
  claimed the workspace lints enforced this since the repository was initialised. Fixed, and
  `scripts/check-lint-config.sh` now proves it by reversal so it cannot silently regress.
  `priority = -1` on the group is mandatory — cargo rejects the config without it.
- **DESIGN.md, README.md, ADR-0003 and three reference pages swept 2026-08-27** to match the
  accepted decisions: bidirectional positioning, one latency floor figure (10–20 µs, was two
  conflicting), `MessageView` corrected to 24 bytes in all four places that claimed 16 or
  "two words", the real `parse_into` signature, D9 rewritten as a parts list, D11 added for
  TLS, an 8-step build order with the initiator in it, and three new gate rows. The
  `codec-dict` plan's doc checklist records which items this closed and which still need code.
- **ADR-0004 and ADR-0005 accepted 2026-08-27** by the owner. -0004 makes the engine
  bidirectional; -0005 makes TLS a transport with the hot-path guarantee stated per mode.
  Both accepted on reasoning, not measurement — ADR-0005's open question 1 is unanswered and
  load-bearing (open item 10).

## Not proven — claimed, researched, or simply not yet run

- **Every figure in [prior-art.md](docs/reference/prior-art.md) is someone else's claim**,
  including all of fix8's and Artio's. Nothing from those projects was run here.
- The **150 ns gates** in `DESIGN.md` §6 are anchored to one measurement on one macOS
  laptop. macOS gives no thread pinning and schedules across three core types — these rank
  designs against each other, they are **not an SLA**.
- **Every figure in `DESIGN.md` §8 (latency budget) is from the literature**, not measured.
  The `tools/w2w` harness replaces that table; nothing in it is evidence until then.
- The ring-buffer hop (200–500 ns) and the busy-poll saving (2–5 µs) are literature figures.
  `benches/dispatch.rs` and `tools/w2w` are what turn them into numbers.
- `MAX_FIELDS = 64` is a starting number. No real message population has been surveyed.
- No crates exist. `cargo metadata` resolves the workspace; `cargo build` errors with
  *"manifest is virtual, and the workspace has no members"*.
- The ADRs are accepted on the strength of the reasoning in them, **not on measurement** — see the §8 caveat above.

## Open items

| # | Item | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Final name.** `nanofixengine` is a placeholder. Free on both crates.io and GitHub: `machfix`, `veloxfix`, `tachyonfix`, `luxfix`, `fixwire`, `fixbolt`, `sohwire` | Nothing yet — but renaming after a crates.io publish is expensive |
| 5 | Ring-buffer policy when the library falls behind: block, drop, or disconnect? | ADR-0002, and the `engine` plan |
| 6 | A Linux box for `tools/w2w`. The design's own §9 says a latency number from a macOS laptop is not a number | Every gate in §6 that matters |
| 7 | **`scripts/fetch-quickfix-assets.sh` tracks mutable `master`.** Every acceptance number in the codec plan (539 lines, 247 with `9=`, 244 with `10=`, 8 tag-set patterns for `35=3`) can change silently upstream. Pin a commit and verify it | Reproducibility of every step-1 gate |
| 8 | **`dict::required()` does not recurse through `<component>`.** `FIX44.xml` uses `<component>` in 632 places; `NewOrderSingle` references `Parties`, `PreAllocGrp`, `TrdgSesGrp`, so the generated table is missing fields | The `session` plan |
| 9 | **The encoder has no DATA invariant.** Writing a dynamic DATA field must regenerate its length field, place it immediately before, and count bytes including embedded `0x01`. Only the read path is specified | Any counterparty that sends `RawData`/`XmlData` |
| 10 | **Can `ktls-core` be driven from a plain non-blocking socket with no async runtime?** Its documented usage is `tokio-rustls`-shaped. If not, ADR-0005's central claim collapses to "userspace rustls only" and the hot-path guarantee goes with it. **Cannot be checked here — needs the Linux box of open item 6** | The TLS plan; ADR-0005 acceptance |
